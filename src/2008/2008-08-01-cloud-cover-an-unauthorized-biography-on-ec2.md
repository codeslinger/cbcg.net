I gave that talk last night to the Philly Lambda group and about 15 people showed up! It seemed like people were into it and enjoyed the presentation and I hope people got a more rounded perspective on what its like to work with EC2 for real, day to day. The slides are listed on my [talks](/talks/TheGoodBadAndUglyOfEC2-PL.pdf) page; enjoy!
