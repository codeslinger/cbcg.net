title: Scala presentation slides are up
---
Last night I gave a presentation on Scala to the Philly Lambda group. The [slides are available here](/talks/Scala.pdf). It was a pretty good time and about 15 people or so showed up for the talk. The space was graciously provided in the really cool-looking [Cira Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cira_Centre) down at 30th St by [Aaron Feng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronfeng/) of Algorithmics. Thanks to Aaron and all who attended; I had a great time presenting!
