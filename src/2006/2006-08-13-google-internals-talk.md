title: Google Internals Talk
---
I recently gave a talk to the [Philly Linux User Group](http://www.phillylinux.org) regarding the internal workings of Google's infrastructure. The [slides are available](/talks/googleinternals/). The presentation was created with [S5](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/) so all that's required to view them is a relatively recent browser.

The talk was pretty well received. I was somewhat surprised at the interest in the material. I have never worked for Google, so I got all my information from their own papers and various other Internet sources. A considerable amount of knowledge is available just at their Google Labs paper index, although they seem to have pared it down in size recently.
