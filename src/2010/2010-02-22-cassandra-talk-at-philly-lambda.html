title: Cassandra Talk at Philly Lambda
---
<p>Gave a presentation on <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html" rel="nofollow">Cassandra</a> tonight at Philly Lambda. The slides are <a href="/talks/Cassandra-PL.pdf" rel="nofollow">on this page</a> but they may be a bit light without the associated speech ;-) Thanks to all the people that came out tonight!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Turns out Eric Brewer not only worked at Inktomi, but was co-founder and Chief Scientist there. I got confused because he used his Berkeley address on the CAP paper. My bad :(</p>
